compile using 
icc -o getfaultGlobal getfaultGlobal.c

reads names of velocitym odel file and srf file. srf file has to have ending .srf and needs to be in lonlat format
usage
echo velocityFileName >! tmp
echo srfFileName.srf >> tmp
getfaultGLobal < tmp

this creates faultGlobal.in which can be used by the conversion programs in the module for linear synthetic seismograms. Note, that a lot of entries are set at -1 because they are not used. So the created file can not be used to create source models.
